# ü§ñ Arduino Sumo Robot with PS4 Controller

This project is an **autonomous and remote-controlled Sumo Robot** built with **Arduino** and controlled via a **PS4 joystick**.  
The robot is designed for **Sumo competitions**, capable of moving with various speed modes, detecting arena edges, and performing attack maneuvers.

## üîç Project Overview
- Controlled using **PS4Controller.h** library  
- Dual motor control with multiple states: **STOP, CW, CCW**  
- Speed modes:
  - **Normal Speed**
  - **Attack Speed**
  - **Turn Speed**
  - **Edge Escape Speed** (to avoid leaving the arena)  
- Gradual speed adjustment for smoother movement  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Components
- Arduino (ESP32 recommended with PS4 controller support)  
- PS4 Controller (Bluetooth connection)  
- Dual DC Motors with motor driver  
- Edge detection mechanism (line sensors)  
- LED indicator
